- Find a way to avoid writing sqlite to disk (use in-memory DB)
- Unit tests to ensure crop variables are zeroed at simulation start/end
- Documentation
- Write a managed implementation of ISocketConnection
  - Very easy. Probably not useful to many people but good proof of concept, so lower priority
- Modify parameters on a per-simulation basis
  - Just extend the replacement protocol a bit.
- Implement string/bool/date/array property replacements
- Implement model replacements?
- (Eventually) move C code to separate repository
- Makefile for C client?
