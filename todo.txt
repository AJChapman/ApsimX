- Implement data retrieval (managed -> native)
  - Need to bypass file IO
- Document the various protocols
- Write a managed implementation of ISocketConnection
  - Very easy. Probably not useful to many people but good proof of concept, so lower priority
- Modify parameters on a per-simulation basis
  - Just extend the replacement protocol a bit.
- Implement string/bool/date/array property replacements
- Implement model replacements?
- Unit tests
- (Eventually) move C code to separate repository
